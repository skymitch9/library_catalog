 * Camera capture, written for iOS Safari first.
 *
 * Everything awkward in here is a WebKit constraint, not a preference:
 *
 * - `getUserMedia` needs a **secure context**. On a phone, `http://192.168.x.x`
 *   is not one, and Safari has no override flag — `navigator.mediaDevices` is
 *   simply `undefined`, so you get a TypeError rather than a permission prompt.
 * - The camera must be started from a **user gesture**, never on mount.
 * - The `<video>` needs `playsinline`, or WebKit forces fullscreen playback.
 * - There is **no torch and no focus control** on iOS. Design for ambient light.
 * - A full-size iPhone frame **exceeds the canvas area cap** and renders blank
 *   *silently*, so downscaling happens during decode via `createImageBitmap`.
 *
 * Nothing here writes to the photo library — there is no web API on iOS that
 * can, and we never hand a file to the system camera. Frames live in memory
 * until they are uploaded, then they are dropped.
