/**
 * Unauthenticated on purpose: this is the endpoint you curl to prove the
 * deployment works before sign-in is even configured.
 *
 * ⚠️ `universes` is here for one reason: it is the only thing that proves the
 * shared list was actually bundled. It comes from catalog-platform, is
 * materialised at build time, and NOTHING ELSE reads it yet — surfacing
 * universes in the UI is a separate job. A dependency nobody exercises is a
 * dependency that breaks quietly, and this line makes a missing or empty list
 * visible in one curl rather than months later in a wrong answer.
 *
 * ⚠️ Envelope normalization (estate item 5, 2026-08-14): also answers
 * `{ ok, service, version, time, detail }`, `detail` holding this route's
 * pre-existing shape verbatim. `version`/`database`/`universes`/`time` stay
 * at the top level too — additive only, nothing removed this pass; see
 * catalog-platform's docs/info/health-envelope.md for the transition plan.
