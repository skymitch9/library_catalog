## Production right now

Measured 2026-08-11 at the end of the overnight run, live version `b82ac811`:

| works | editions | copies | audiobook holdings | accessories | no cover | paperback |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **224** | 227 | 108 | **46** live | 32 | **6** | **0** |

Overnight movement: covers **57 → 6**, details queue **78 questions → 7**,
audiobook holdings **40 → 46** with the false claims removed.

`/api/health` 200; `/api/series`, `/api/me`, `/api/crowdfunding` return 401
(auth) rather than 500.

⚠️ These numbers move *during* sessions — works went 120 → 140 → 162 → 214 in one
afternoon of scanning. Any figure here is a measurement with a timestamp, never a
constant. Re-measure before relying on one.

## ⚠️ Read this first: the run is finished

**Every actionable item on this list is done.** What is left in **Blocked**
below is blocked on the *user* — questions only they can answer about physical
objects in their house, or judgement calls about their own data. Nothing there
is waiting on more work, and re-running the tooling will not clear any of it.

Seven things want a human:

1. Confirm the Illumicrate Percy Jackson set is the 5-book original series.
2. Say what "+ Books" meant in the Words of Radiance tier — BackerKit holds no
   itemisation for that pledge at all.
3. Confirm the published title of the *Unstoppable* novel so it can be split out
   of the DCC RPG pledge.
4. Resolve *Secret Ingredient* vs *Pengrooms*, which claim contradictory series.
5. Give five reward lines a format — the hints name none, and `suggestFormat`
   rightly declined to guess.
6. Add subtitles to three board books so they become identifiable.
7. Decide whether the heygabi.ai `/todo` page should be public. It is built and
   pushed but **deliberately not deployed**.

## Overnight autonomous run — started 2026-08-10 ~22:35

The user went to bed with: *"keep the working going until everything on the todo
list is done, take breaks as necessary to not hit usage limit but everytime it
refreshes you keep going. if you need me to intervene set it aside and keep going
on with other things."*

Rules being followed: stop starting agents at **93% weekly**, keep working
conversationally to **97%**; the session window is the cheap one (it resets in
hours) and the weekly is the real ceiling. Anything needing the user goes in
**Blocked** above rather than stalling the run.

Five agents were in flight at bedtime: mark-as-arrived (+ clickable series on
cards), audiobook matching + automatic covers, a browser verification sweep,
and the bulk details-queue clear. ⚠️ The queue agent was told to **report the
cost before spending it** — the research path is a paid API and the backlog is
in the hundreds.

## Rollback points

The user permits pushing straight to `main` while this site is pre-release, **on
condition that a rollback id is recorded**. Contrast the board game catalog,
which has real users now and where changes are "more damning".

| Date | Pushed | Roll back to | Worker version |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-08-10 | `4d19ae4` (16 commits: five agent branches, covers, formats, work log) | **`c75d174`** | `86e453ed` |

To undo the code: `git reset --hard c75d174 && git push --force-with-lease`.
⚠️ **That does not undo the database.** Migrations `0013`, `0020` and `0021` are
applied to production and are additive; leaving them in place is safe and is the
right call. The 99 board-book format corrections and the 40 audiobook holdings
are data changes with no down-migration — re-running the scripts is the remedy,
not a revert.

To roll the Worker back without touching git, redeploy a prior version id from
the Cloudflare dashboard.

## Blocked — the live list

| | Item | Blocker | Who clears it |
|---|---|---|---|
| ⏸️ | **Words of Radiance "+ Books" cannot be itemised from BackerKit** | Checked the pledge detail page directly: unlike every other pledge, this one has **no "included items" control at all** — the tier string *"Signed Words of Radiance Leatherbound + 10 Radiant Packs + 1 Backer Pack + Books"* is the entire record BackerKit holds. So "+ Books" plural and the Radiant/Backer Packs cannot be resolved from this source. | User — only they know what actually arrived |
| ⏸️ | **"DCC RPG + Unstoppable" needs splitting** | ⚠️ Earlier note said "not on Kickstarter, probably Indiegogo" — **that was wrong**. It is a **BackerKit account 1** pledge ($490 on the Pledges tab, $367.50 on Surveys — the two figures disagree, which is also unexplained). The RPG belongs in the board game catalog and the *Unstoppable* novel in the library. ⚠️ No work has been minted for it because the exact published title is unconfirmed, and a guessed title is a permanent duplicate. | User confirms the title, or Claude reads the campaign page |
| ⏸️ | **10 reward lines have no printing** | Lines matched their works but no `edition` exists for the specific printing a campaign delivered, so they landed with `edition_id NULL`. The importer never mints an edition — by design. | Create the editions in the app, then re-run the import |
| ⏸️ | **Two books claim contradictory series** | #213 *Secret Ingredient* is recorded as "The Pengrooms" vol 2 while #215 *Pengrooms* is "Pringle & Finn" vol 1. Both were auto-filled, both carry a source URL, both are plausible — and they cannot both be right. | User — needs eyes on the actual books |
| ⏸️ | **Three books the model refused to identify** | #141 *Touch and Explore*, #160 *Bizzy Bear*, #174 *I love you, little bear* — bare series-line titles with no subtitle and no ISBN. It declined rather than guessing, which is the behaviour we want. **Re-running will not help; adding a subtitle will.** | User adds a subtitle |
| ⏸️ | **Confirm the Percy Jackson set is the 5-book original series** | Imported, but the vendor page never lists the individual titles — the five are *supplied by Claude*, not read off the page. Low risk, still an assumption. | User, when awake |
| ⏸️ | **6 works have no cover, and they are genuinely obscure** | **57 → 6** overnight: 12 stranded, 20 Google Books, 18 LLM, **4 from a new free title-search rung**. The remaining six are a Korean Tinyping board book, a Paw Patrol shaped board book, *Home Sweet Home*, *What If Everybody Said That?*, *How to Catch a Loveosaurus* and *The Nightmare Before Christmas* — no free rung and no paid lookup reached them. This is close to the real floor. | Nobody — accept, or hand-supply a URL |

### Cleared since the last revision

- ~~Main checkout dirty with unclaimed manager-role work~~ — it was the
  people/roles feature from earlier in the session; it committed itself as
  `a138019` + `c75d174`.
- ~~Deploy blocked by a dirty tree~~ — main is clean; five branches merged.
- ~~Barnes & Noble sign-in~~ — done, scanned, complete.
- ~~Kickstarter password verification~~ — user fixed; all 62 pledges enumerated.
- ~~Indiegogo sign-in~~ — done; only 3 pledges exist.
- ~~Worktrees typechecking against the main checkout~~ — no `node_modules` in a
  worktree made Node resolve `@lc/core` upward. `npm install` in the worktree
  fixes it. All five agents confirmed.

## Shipped this session

| | Item | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| 🚢 | Newest scanned book at the top of the queue | `6732f331`. ⚠️ Row/index pairing happens *before* the reverse — `index` is the offset the server patches. |
| 🚢 | Covers reach the work, not just the edition | `74ddd86`. Cover was landing one table away from where every list renders it. |
| ✅ | Stranded covers backfilled | `scripts/backfill-work-covers.mjs`. 35 filled, 0 stranded. |
| ✅ | **Board books corrected to hardcover** | `scripts/fix-scanned-formats.mjs`. 99 editions; production now has **0 paperback**. Dated on purpose — real paperbacks are arriving from B&N. |
| 🚢 | Series restructure | Print/Ebook/Audio chips, "Bought more than once", searchable series list. Migration `0010`. |
| ✅ | Audiobook holdings backfilled | 40 written, confirmed by re-read. |
| 🚢 | Format filter + preorder tag | Filter means **"has a physical edition"**, not "physical only". Caught `stats.wanted` silently summing wanted + preordered. |
| 🚢 | Editing an edition | `PATCH`/`DELETE /api/editions/:id` + Editions panel. `updateEditionSchema` had existed since day one with no route behind it. |
| 🚢 | Drive links hidden for physical books | Rule: show only when a **non-physical edition** exists. ISBN deliberately not consulted. |
| 🚢 | Automatic first-pass lookup | Ported from the sibling. **Concurrency is 1** — an 8-way `Promise.all` funnels through a 1100 ms serialising queue; measured 8885 ms for 8. |
| 🚢 | In-queue duplicates, unresolved barcodes, SKUs | Duplicates were deduped server-side at append time and the flag was never read. Non-Bookland codes are now addable rows carrying the raw code. |
| 🚢 | **Auto-apply missing details** | The queue writes what it finds instead of asking. Migration `0013` adds `decided_how`, so machine-written values stay distinguishable from asserted ones. `GET /auto-applied` + `POST /undo` give bulk recoverability. |
| 🚢 | Accessories + crowdfunding provenance | Migrations `0020`, `0021`. Four tables; campaign/pledge split so **two BackerKit accounts** can back one campaign. |
| ✅ | All 62 Kickstarter pledges enumerated | 15 library, 45 board games, 2 neither, 8 mixed, 6 flagged ambiguous rather than guessed. |
| ✅ | **Mark as arrived, in batches** | `6593a7e`. Ported from the sibling onto the **wishlist**, not a book page — a pledge delivers several *works*, so no work page can hold the batch. No migration, no bulk endpoint: N × `PATCH /api/copies/:id`, `allSettled`. ⚠️ `arrivedPatch` also dates the copy, which the sibling does not — it dropped `acquired_on`; we kept it. Only when empty, so a known date is never overwritten. |
| ✅ | A card's series is a link | `6593a7e`. ⚠️ The card had to stop being a `<button>` first — an `<a>` inside one is invalid HTML. Title is now a stretched link; series sits above it on z-index. |

## Staged, waiting on the user to run — 2026-08-10

All dry-run and verified against production. **Nothing below has been written.**
Every one needs `LC_AUDIOBOOK_ROOT` only where noted, and all are idempotent.

Run **in this order** — the first is free and the second deliberately skips what
the first fixes.

```bash
# 1. Lift 12 stranded edition covers onto their works. No network.
node scripts/backfill-work-covers.mjs --remote --commit

# 2. Fetch the 20 covers Google Books holds. ~2 min, free (keyed).
npm run backfill:missing-covers -- --remote --commit

# 3. Three asserted audiobook aliases: Tamer 9, Tamer 10, The Primal Hunter.
LC_AUDIOBOOK_ROOT=C:/Users/nbasl/OneDrive/Documents/vs-code-repos/bookbuddy/audiobook_catalog \
  npm run seed:audiobook-aliases -- --remote --commit

# 4. Re-run the audiobook match so the Tamer fix and the aliases both land.
LC_AUDIOBOOK_ROOT=C:/Users/nbasl/OneDrive/Documents/vs-code-repos/bookbuddy/audiobook_catalog \
  npm run backfill:audiobooks -- --remote --commit
```

⚠️ **Step 4 rewrites `audiobook_holding`.** It marks the five wrong Tamer rows
and the wrong Primal Hunter row `stale_at` rather than deleting them (migration
0003's rule), and writes the correct rows for Tamer 7–10. Expect **six fewer
false claims** and the honest total to land near 45.

### Optional and **paid** — not run, gate separately

```bash
# ⚠️ COSTS MONEY. ~6c/book × 25 books ≈ $1.50, estimated from list prices.
npm run backfill:missing-covers -- --remote --llm            # dry run first
npm run backfill:missing-covers -- --remote --llm --commit
```

Yield is **unmeasured** — no sweep has been run. Every URL it proposes is fetched
and size-checked before it can be written, so the failure mode is "found
nothing", not "stored a dead link".

## Open work, not blocked

| | Item |
|---|---|
| 🔨 | **Keep GitHub current** — the user permits pushing straight to `main` while this site is pre-release, *provided a rollback id is recorded*. Contrast the board game catalog, which has real users now and where changes are "more damning". |
| 💤 | **Cross-project TODO page on heygabi.ai** — all projects, tagged one/some/all/landing. Explicitly deferred: "we will swap to it later". |
| 💤 | Gamefound — excluded, no books. |

## BackerKit import — RUN against production 2026-08-10

`npm run import:crowdfunding -- --remote --commit`. Written: **6 campaigns, 6
pledges, 4 reward lines across 4 books, 0 accessories.**

Per-pledge, verified by re-reading the database:

| Campaign | Account | Lines |
|---|---|---|
| Surprise! Four Secret Novels | acct 2 | **4** ✅ |
| Hoid's Storybook Collection | acct 1 | 0 |
| The Primal Hunter Deluxe Box | acct 1 | 0 |
| DCC: CROCODILE | acct 1 | 0 |
| Ascend Online: Legacy of the Fallen | acct 1 | 0 |
| Words of Radiance Leatherbound | acct 2 | 0 |

⚠️ **The five zeroes are the importer working as designed, not failing.** It
creates no `work` and no `edition`, because a campaign's spelling of a title is
exactly what mints a duplicate. Five books must be created by hand first, then
the import re-run — it is an idempotent upsert keyed on campaign `externalId`,
so a second run adds the missing lines without duplicating the six pledges.

Books to create: *Fires of December* (Sanderson), *The Primal Hunter* (Zogarth),
*Dungeon Crawler Carl: Crocodile* (Dinniman), *Ascend Online: Legacy of the
Fallen* (Chmilenko), *Words of Radiance* (Sanderson).

Kickstarter, Indiegogo and Barnes & Noble are **deliberately not in the input
file**. B&N is a shop, not a promise — `copy.vendor` covers it. Four Kickstarter
pledges are the same pledges as BackerKit account 2's, so *Four Secret Novels*
is recorded once, under `platform: kickstarter`.

## Purchase scan — staged

JSON lives in the session scratchpad and is **never committed** (it carries order
data). `scripts/crowdfunding-scan.json` is gitignored for the same reason.

| Source | State | Books |
|---|---|---|
| Barnes & Noble | ✅ | 7 importable, 1 cancelled skipped, **4 are preorders** |
| BackerKit acct 1 | ✅ | 4 pledges + 28 survey entries |
| Indiegogo | ✅ | Space Knight 5 and 6 |
| Kickstarter | ✅ | 15 pledges containing books |
| BackerKit acct 2 | ✅ | The games-heavy account. 3 books: **Words of Radiance Leatherbound** ($650, genuinely signed), **Surprise! Four Secret Novels** ($620, one line = four works), **Ascend Online Bk 1 Collector's** |
| Illumicrate | ✅ | One-off Percy Jackson set — do NOT scan the rest of that site |

⚠️ **The two BackerKit accounts and Kickstarter overlap.** *Four Secret Novels*,
*Ascend Online Book 1*, *An Unexpected Wedding Invitation* and *Coral Island*
appear in **both** the Kickstarter enumeration and BackerKit account 2 — same
pledges, campaign run on Kickstarter and fulfilled through BackerKit. Importing
both sources naively double-counts every one. The importer must match on campaign
`externalId`, and a pledge's `platform` should record where *our pledge* lives
separately from where the survey lives.

⚠️ **The BackerKit trap:** the Pledges tab showed 4 items; the Surveys tab showed
28. *Ascend Online* appears only under Surveys. Any BackerKit scan must read
`/c/users/active_projects` under **all three** filters, not just `/c/users/pledges`.

### Classification rules the user set

- **RPG and D&D material → board game catalog**, even bound hardcovers.
- **Graphic novels → library, but tagged.**
- **Audiobooks → not catalogued here.** Record that a pledge included one.
- **Mixed pledges must be split**, never collapsed.

### Shapes the model has to survive

One pledge routinely delivers ebook + print + audiobook. One line item can cover
several works ("Collector's Edition Trilogy" is three books). Signed/numbered
arrives as reward *prose*, not a field. High-value pledges are mostly
accessories — Primal Hunter is 1 book and ~23 pins, standees and plushies. Some
accessories are digital.

## Details queue emptied — 2026-08-10

**224 works · 3 still holding a gap · 0 findings pending.** Two passes, on branch
`feature/apply-pending-findings`.

| | Pass | Cost |
|---|---|---|
| ✅ | **162 findings that predate auto-apply, applied.** 61 works. Already bought and paid for by 61 past runs and simply never written down — this is what the owner was hand-clicking "use it" on. `scripts/apply-pending-findings.mjs` | **$0.00** |
| ✅ | **69 lookups run to clear what was left.** `scripts/research-queue.mjs`, 0 failed | **$1.11** (estimated $1.41) |

Research has now cost **$6.06** over 301 runs. Tokens only — Anthropic bills its
server-side web searches separately.

⚠️ **The count went UP before it went down, and that is the pipeline working.**
After the backlog landed, the queue read *66 works / 78 questions* — more
questions than before, of which **57 were volume numbers**. Filling in 32 series
names is what created them: `detailFieldsFor` refuses to ask "which volume is
this?" of a book with no series, so the question does not exist until the series
is known. The queue got **longer in count and shorter in kind**. Do not "fix" a
rising number here without reading which field it is in.

⚠️ **The page's own bulk button cannot finish this job**, and its count is
misleading rather than wrong. `outstanding` filters on `runs[workId] === undefined`
and `runs` is `latestRuns` — one row per work *ever* looked up. With 66 works
still owing an answer it offered **"Look up 5"**. The other 61 had been looked up
weeks earlier, before they had a series to be a volume of. The per-row button
reaches them; the script is that, unattended.

**Three works could not be identified and are deliberately left open** — the model
declined rather than guess, which is the behaviour we want: #141 *Touch and
Explore* (Scholastic), #160 *Bizzy Bear* (Nosy Crow), #174 *I love you, little
bear* (Judi Abbot). All three are bare series-line titles with no subtitle, ISBN
or year, where any match would attach another book's facts. Fix by adding the
subtitle, not by re-running.

**Everything is machine-decided and reversible.** All 311 values carry
`decided_how = 'auto'`, so `GET /api/research/auto-applied` lists them and
`POST /api/research/undo` takes them back, ten at a time. Nothing a person had
asserted was touched: `applyFinding` writes only into blanks, and the 162-finding
pass additionally refused any finding whose work+field already carried a
human verdict (zero did).

### Two things found by running it

- ⚠️ **`updateWork` rewrites `sort_title`, `primary_author` and `work_key` from
  title/authors on *every* update**, whatever the patch asked for. So a stored
  value that has drifted gets silently corrected by a write that only meant to
  fill in a year. Measured across all 224 works: `sort_title` disagreed on **5**
  (works 224–228, the crowdfunding-import ones, which kept their leading article
  and sort under "The"); `primary_author` and `work_key` disagreed on **none**.
  The five are now corrected. **`work_key` drifting would be the serious one** —
  it is the join to 860 audiobook reviews, so a silent rewrite moves a book's
  reviews instead of failing visibly.
- ⚠️ **Two books in one series ended up with two different series names.** #213
  *Secret Ingredient* is "The Pengrooms" vol 2; #215 *Pengrooms* is "Pringle &
  Finn" vol 1. Both findings cite a real source (the author's Kickstarter, and
  Goodreads' series page) and both are plausible — Paul Castle's series is
  indexed under both names. They cannot both be right in one catalog. Needs a
  person to pick one.

Every volume number written as a *value* (15 of them) carries a source URL and a
basis that names the page. None hedge. Checked on purpose: a wrong volume number
is worse than a blank, because a filled column is never re-asked.

---

## Browser verification sweep — 2026-08-10

The first real browser pass over everything five agent branches shipped. **Zero
console errors** across every screen. Verdicts:

**Works:** scan picker and its four tabs · queue newest-first · duplicate,
unresolved-barcode and SKU rows · Editions panel with two-click delete ·
accessories (23 rows with kind chips, quantity, DIGITAL tag) · crowdfunding
provenance · `WorkFields` in-place editing · series list search/sort/gaps ·
"Bought more than once" · Edition and Print/Ebook filters with recomputing
counts · details-queue auto-apply with per-row and bulk undo · Drive links
correct in both directions.

**Two correctness bugs found and fixed** (`6344cc4`, deployed `95af9fbd`):

1. ⚠️ **The series page asserted audio it had only guessed at.** Tamer read
   *"All 5 held as ebooks and on audio"* when all five matched the same generic
   series-level row by containment. The per-rung chip *does* hedge with a `?`,
   but that chip is suppressed when every rung agrees — and folding
   `matchedVia` away in `signatureOf` is what made them agree. Both the chip and
   the sentence were individually correct, which is why only a browser caught it.
2. ⚠️ **"All N held…" overstated.** The count came from the whole series while
   the signature behind it came from ladder rungs only, which exclude wishlist
   entries and off-number-line works. *The Completionist Chronicles* said "All 4
   … on audio" while the series list said 3. Now gated on the counts agreeing.

Also corrected: the "Type a title" blurb promised *"Looks the rest up as you
type"* over a tab that makes no such request, and contradicted itself by
promising "no code" when the only lookup offered is by ISBN.

**Still open from the sweep:**
- ⚠️ **Mobile is UNVERIFIED and cannot currently be verified.** `resize_window`
  returns `Successfully resized … to 390x844` and the viewport does not move —
  `read_page` reports it unchanged every time. Two separate agents hit this.
  **Distrust any mobile verdict from this tooling.**
- The route is **`/add`, not `/scan`**.
- Per-rung Print/Ebook/Audio chips have never actually rendered — every series
  in production has a uniform ladder, so they are suppressed by design.
- The preorder tag has never rendered either: zero preordered and zero wanted
  copies exist. It will first appear when the 4 B&N preorders are imported.
- Cosmetic: two stacked "Cancel" buttons in the accessories panel; an
  `UNCLASSIFIED` chip that is accurate but the only jargon in an otherwise
  plain-English panel.

## Known-imperfect, carried forward

- ⚠️ **Audiobook match rate is 19% — 43 of 224.** The rate fell because the
  catalog grew, not because matching got worse: matches went 42 → 43 while works
  went 219 → 224. Honest ceiling: ~35 misses are board books and 38 are
  fan-translated light novels with no English audio.
- ❌ **"Cradle is the group worth chasing" was wrong — retire it.** Searched all
  1,075 audiobook rows for every Cradle title (Unsouled, Soulsmith, Blackflame,
  Skysworn, Ghostwater, Underlord, Uncrowned, Wintersteel, Bloodline, Reaper,
  Dreadgod, Waybound) and for "cradle" anywhere in the file including
  descriptions: **zero hits**. Will Wight's only audiobooks here are *The Last
  Horizon* 1–3, which already match exactly. No alias can create a match for an
  audiobook the household does not own. Those 12 works are a genuine miss.
- ✅ **The five *Tamer* volumes are fixed.** Diagnosis: containment is a
  *substring* test, and our "Book 7" vs their "7" differ by a word in the middle,
  so the correct numbered row was never a candidate — only the series-level
  "Tamer: King of Dinosaurs" was. Fixed in `matching.ts` with a volume-marker
  fold plus a rule that containment may differ in words but never in numbers.
  Books 7 and 8 now match their own rows; 9 and 10 need the alias seed (the
  audiobook titles carry "Kickstarter Edition", 0.56 against a 0.6 floor); **11
  correctly matches nothing.** Same fix removed a second false positive: *The
  Primal Hunter* (book 1) had matched *The Primal Hunter 10*.
- ⚠️ **A false positive that was caught:** "An Unexpected Wedding Invitation (5e)"
  has add-ons literally labelled "(Book)" that are 5e modules. Would have
  polluted the library silently.
- ⚠️ **The top bar overflows at 360px** — pre-existing, found while measuring the
  arrivals panel. At a 356px viewport `Sign out` sits at `right: 414`, so the
  document scrolls sideways on every screen. The `@media (max-width: 26rem)` rule
  shrinks `.topbar__brand` and that is not enough. Deliberately **not** fixed
  here: the owner has asked that the header and nav stay identical to the board
  game catalog's, so it is a decision, not a tidy-up.
- **"Digitally signed" is not signed** — Illumicrate. Goes in `edition_notes`, per
  the user, not `copy.is_signed`.
- **The "Type a title" tab is unfinished** — its blurb promises lookup-as-you-type
  and there is no title-search endpoint behind it.
- **`work_relation` is live but empty.**
- **No browser verification** of the accessories panels, the undo UI, `WorkFields`,
  or the 390px phone layout of the series page.
- An agent killed 56 `workerd` processes with a blanket match while chasing a
  stuck port — restart any dev worker from around then.

---

## House rules that keep biting

- `git commit -F <file>`, never `-m`. PowerShell mangles quotes and em dashes.
- Migrate **before** deploying, so new code never meets an old schema.
- `packages/core` has a load-bearing import order — nothing under `src/` may
  import from `index.ts`. **Typecheck does not catch it.**
- Backfills must **confirm by re-reading the database**. `execute()` returns
  statements run, not rows changed. ⚠️ Worse: the read helper in
  `scripts/lib/d1.mjs` returned an **empty result** on one run and the script
  reported "nothing to do" over 99 live rows. A second run behaved.
- ⚠️ **Two branches can add the same export and git will merge both silently.**
  `EDITION_MEDIA` was declared twice with no conflict marker; it surfaced only as
  `TS2451`. After any multi-branch merge, run typecheck *and* count the tests.
- ⚠️ **Check the test count after merging.** Expected arithmetic caught a real
  loss before: 91 → 95 → 105 → 118 → 134.
- Assign migration numbers with **wide gaps** when several agents run at once.
  Two agents were both told "0010 or higher" and both took it; one was already
  applied to production. Renumbered to `0020`/`0021`.
